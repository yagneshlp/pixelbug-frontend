The frontend for the website of Pixelbug, NIT Trichy's Photography Club. 
The backend is a serverless compute engine AWS Lambda which handles the image resize and compression based on the api parameters. 
THe CDN service is an AWs lambda compute unit that takes in RAW images in a S3 bucket, and will churn out compressed and resized images as per the need, with the help of values from end points. The resizing and compression is taken care by a Lambda function, which gets triggered by API Gateway. If the requested size of the image is already available, that version is sent. If not, it is generated and sent, thus ensuring unnecessary conversions are not being made, and cached data is used when available.
